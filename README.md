# Real vs Perceived Security

This is a slide pack from a small presentation i made at [foo cafe](http://www.foocafe.org/) for the group [malmo js](http://malmojs.com/).

The link to the talk will be added as soon as i get it.

### Tools

I have generated this presentation using a small ruby gem called [reveal-ck](https://github.com/jedcn/reveal-ck). It is super easy to use and generate nice presentations writing only markdown and html.
