Real vs Perceived security

Is security and the feeling of security the same thing? Definitely not! Humans sense of security and risk assesment has evolved over a long time and is not well suited to asses the threats we face on the internet. It is much better at deciding the correct response when we encounter a lion. 
Often messures taken to improve security can have the opposite effect.
